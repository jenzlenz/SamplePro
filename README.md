I am enrolled in a 4-5 month QA Automation Bootcamp from Nov 2017 through April 2018.  
This repository is where I put my work done in this program.
The project is written in Java, and uses TestNg, Maven, Selenium.
The purpose is to write code to test various scenarios while learning the different ways of accessing and manipulating the web page elements.
